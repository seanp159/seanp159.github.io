		<h1>Corporation</h1>
			<b>Mandate</b>
				<p>The 1991 Broadcasting Act states that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as the national public broadcaster, should provide radio and television services incorporating a wide range of programming that informs, enlightens and entertains.</p>
				<p>The programming provided by the Corporation should:</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>be predominantly and distinctively Canadian,</li>
						<li>reflect Canada and its regions to national and regional audiences, while serving the special needs of those regions,</li>
						<li>actively contribute to the flow and exchange of cultural expression,</li>
						<li>be in English and in French, reflecting the different needs and circumstances of each official language community, including the particular needs and circumstances of English and French linguistic minorities,</li>
						<li>strive to be of equivalent quality in English and French,</li>
						<li>contribute to shared national consciousness and identity,</li>
						<li>be made available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means and as resources become available for the purpose, and</li>
						<li>reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada.</li>
					</ul>
			<b>Management</b>
				<p>As a crown corporation, the CBC operates at arm's length (autonomously) from the government in its day-to-day business. The corporation is governed by the Broadcasting Act[16] of 1991, under a board of directors and is directly responsible to Parliament through the Department of Canadian Heritage. General management of the organization is in the hands of a president, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada in Council, on the advice of the prime minister.</p>
				<p>According to The Hill Times, a clause in Bill C-60, an omnibus budget implementation bill introduced by the government of Stephen Harper in 2013, "appears to contradict a longstanding arm's-length relationship between the independent CBC and any government in power."[17][18] The clause allows the "prime minister's cabinet to approve salaries, working conditions and collective bargaining positions for the CBC.</p>
			
			<b>Board of Directors</b>
				<p>In accordance with the Broadcasting Act, a board of directors is responsible for the management of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The board is made up of 12 members, including the Chair and the President and CEO. A current list of directors is available from the Canadian Governor in Council here.</p>
