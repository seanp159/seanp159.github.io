		<p> Alright mother fucker, lets see how this works. Basically just going to mess around and add a bunch of features to this and see how it all works.</p>
		
		<b>I'm going to make a list</b>
		<p>Some things that I have been doing a lot of lately are 
			<ul>		
				<li>Drinking</li> 
				<li>Smoking</li> 
				<li>Listening to McGruff</li>
			</ul>				
		</p>		
		
		<b>Now I'm going to try and make a table</b>
			
		
		<table>
			<caption>Caption?</caption>
			
			<tr>
				<th>Activity</th>
				<th>Did I do it?</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Drinking</td>
				<td>Yes</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Smoking</td>
				<td>Yes</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>McGruff</td>
				<td>Yes</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
